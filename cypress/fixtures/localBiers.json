    "description": "We love hops. We adore and worship their profile ability to transform beer. You could say that we have a terminal addiction. To celebrate this fetish weâ€™re heroing our favourites in single hopped limited releases. No also starring, no extras, no compromise. The Hop is the Hero. A biscuity malty backbone builds to intense resinous pine with pithy citrus notes, culminating in a grapefruit hit and a long bitter finish. Our Ace in the hole, devastatingly singular, deliciously bitter. Serving up an Ace each and every time.",
